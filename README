Ctrl Extension Template

These files are a base framework for a new WinCC OA Ctrl Extension.
The tool newPVSSCtrlExt in $API_ROOT creates a new Ctrl Extension project
by creating implementation files based on these files

What you have to do then is simply check all
// TODO
comments in the files and fill in your real implementations.

(Even without any modification you have already a compilable
 and runable new WinCC OA Ctrl Extension, with a simple
 add(a, b, sum) function)

To install copy the compiled Ctrl Extension (*.so or *.dll)
into your projects "bin" directory

Enjoy!
